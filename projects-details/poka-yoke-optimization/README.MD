# Optimization of tractor production through strategic poka-yoke implementation
Devised and implemented poka-yokes in a production facility handling over 100 tractor variants. Developed a barcode scanning system for part verification and integrated a comprehensive database with SAPâ€™s BOM. Collaborated with programming and stores teams to improve part identification, stacking, and tagging methods. This significantly mitigated the risk of incorrect part feeding. Training of operators on the new system led to enhanced production efficiency, reduced complaint reports, and improved product quality and customer satisfaction.
