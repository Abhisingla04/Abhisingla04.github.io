## About Me

As a results-oriented Mechanical Engineer with a Bachelor's degree from Sant Longowal Institute of Engineering and Technology [SLIET], I bring a strong academic background and practical experience in the field. My work spans various facets of mechanical engineering, including project management, design optimization, and quality assurance.

During my tenure at Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd., I excelled as an Assistant Manager, driving process improvements and new product introductions. Prior to that, as a Graduate Trainee, I honed my skills in manufacturing operations and quality control.

My internship experiences at Vehicle R&D Establishment (VRDE) and Tema India Ltd. have equipped me with valuable insights into research methodologies and industrial practices. Additionally, I have contributed to the academic community through publications and presentations at international conferences.

I am proficient in utilizing simulation tools (viz. MSC Adams, Ansys Workbench) for engineering analysis and design optimization. My accolades include the "Pride of Punjab" Award from BAJA SAEINDIA, recognizing my contributions to automotive engineering.

I am passionate about leveraging my expertise to drive innovation and solve complex engineering challenges. Let's connect to explore potential collaborations and opportunities in the engineering field.
