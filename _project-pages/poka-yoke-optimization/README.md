# Optimization of Tractor Production Through Strategic Poka-Yoke Implementation

## Overview

This project involved the strategic implementation of **poka-yokes** in a production facility handling over **100 tractor variants**. The goal was to optimize the production process and improve product quality and customer satisfaction.

## Key Achievements

- **Devised and Implemented Poka-Yokes**: Developed several fail-safing mechanisms to prevent errors in the production process.
- **Barcode Scanning System for Part Verification**: Developed a barcode scanning system to verify parts. This helped to ensure that the correct parts were used at each stage of production.
- **Integration with SAP's BOM**: Integrated a comprehensive database with SAP's Bill of Materials (BOM). This provided a reliable source of information for the production process.
- **Collaboration with Programming and Stores Teams**: Worked closely with the programming and stores teams to improve part identification, stacking, and tagging methods. This significantly mitigated the risk of incorrect part feeding.
- **Training of Operators**: Conducted training for operators on the new system. This led to enhanced production efficiency, reduced complaint reports, and improved product quality and customer satisfaction.
