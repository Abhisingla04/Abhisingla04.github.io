    <h1>Optimization of Tractor Production Through Strategic Poka-Yoke Implementation</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project involved the strategic implementation of <strong>poka-yokes</strong> in a production facility handling over <strong>100 tractor variants</strong>. The goal was to optimize the production process and improve product quality and customer satisfaction.</p>
    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Devised and Implemented Poka-Yokes</strong>: Developed several fail-safing mechanisms to prevent errors in the production process.</li>
        <li><strong>Barcode Scanning System for Part Verification</strong>: Developed a barcode scanning system to verify parts. This helped to ensure that the correct parts were used at each stage of production.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with SAP's BOM</strong>: Integrated a comprehensive database with SAP's Bill of Materials (BOM). This provided a reliable source of information for the production process.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration with Programming and Stores Teams</strong>: Worked closely with the programming and stores teams to improve part identification, stacking, and tagging methods. This significantly mitigated the risk of incorrect part feeding.</li>
        <li><strong>Training of Operators</strong>: Conducted training for operators on the new system. This led to enhanced production efficiency, reduced complaint reports, and improved product quality and customer satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
