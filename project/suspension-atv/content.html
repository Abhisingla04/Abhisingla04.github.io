    <title>Suspension Design of All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV)</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Suspension Design of All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV)</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The suspension system of an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) is a critical component that contributes to the vehicle’s stability, ride comfort, and handling. The design and optimization of the suspension system are crucial to the overall performance of the ATV. This report presents a detailed analysis of the suspension system for the ATV designed by the team junkyard warriors.</p>
    
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
<P>    
<ul>
        <li><strong>Selection of Suitable Suspension Type:</strong> The type of suspension should be chosen in accordance with the stipulations of the rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Development of a Simplified and Effective Suspension System:</strong> The suspension system should be designed to be straightforward, provide excellent guidance, and possess superior shock absorption capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization of Suspension Hard Points:</strong> The hard points of the suspension need to be optimized to enhance the vehicle’s handling stability and ride smoothness.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimization of Changes in Wheel Alignment Parameters:</strong> The dynamic range of wheel alignment parameters, including wheel camber angle, wheel toe angle, kingpin inclination angle, and kingpin caster angle, should be minimized to bolster the car’s steering stability under a variety of operating conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhancement of Anti-Roll Performance:</strong> The roll angle stiffness of the suspension should be improved to boost lateral stability during turning and when encountering obstacles.</li>
        <li><strong>Realization of Lightweight Design:</strong> The structure should be as simplified as possible and the weight reduced, while still complying with the rules and ensuring structural strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Establishment of Anticipated Suspension Performance:</strong> A set of suspension hard points and parameters should be determined, and the expected suspension performance, such as the roll angle under extreme cornering conditions and wheel alignment parameters during tire bounce, should be set.</li>
        <li><strong>Execution of Motion Simulation and Analysis:</strong> Modeling should be performed in ADAMS, followed by motion simulation. The simulation results should be analyzed to ensure they meet the expected suspension performance. If they do not, the initial suspension hard points and parameters should be modified, and the modified suspension parameters should be used for modeling and motion simulation until the simulation results align with the expected suspension performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Suspension System Design</h2>
    <p>The suspension system of the ATV is designed to absorb shocks and maintain contact between the tires and the ground. The design parameters for the suspension system are as follows:</p>

       <h2>Suspension System Analysis</h2>
    <p>The suspension components were subjected to various forces during the operation of the ATV. The components were analyzed using CAE tools to ensure their structural integrity under these forces. The force applied on the wishbones was 1G, and the maximum stress observed was 552.35Mpa, resulting in a factor of safety of 1.245.</p>

        </div>
    
    <h2>Suspension System Validation</h2>
    <p>The suspension system was validated through several tests including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gradeability Test:</strong> The ATV was run on a 30° ramp to validate the gradeability of the suspension system.</li>
        <li><strong>Drop Test:</strong> The vehicle was lifted to a height of 10 ft from the ground level and dropped to test the shock-absorbing capacity of the suspension system.</li>
        <li><strong>Suspension & Traction Test:</strong> The ATV was driven through obstacles to test the suspension system’s response to different terrains.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The suspension system of the ATV was successfully designed, analyzed, and validated. The system performed well in all the tests, demonstrating its ability to withstand various terrains and conditions. The team will continue to optimize the suspension system to further improve the ATV’s performance.</p>
