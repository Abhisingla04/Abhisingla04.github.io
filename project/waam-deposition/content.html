        <h1>Investigation of deposition strategy on wire-arc additive manufacturing of 
austenitic stainless steel components</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The present project aims at studying and investigating strategies of metal deposition of wire arc additive manufacturing in austenitic stainless steel (AISI 316 L) using cold metal transfer technique. This study lays out a foundation of standardizing the welding parameters and deposition strategy for AISI 316 L. Two walls with different path strategies were fabricated, and the strategy with minimum material wastage, least distortion, minimum surface porosity, and best surface appearance was selected.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, is a family of novel manufacturing techniques in which material is added layer-by-layer to build objects based on 3D model data. In recent years, AM methods have become increasingly adopted in many industries, such as aerospace and biomedical, due to their ability to produce complex functional components with high precision, reduced material waste, minimized assembly processes, and reduced tooling costs.</p>
        
        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <h3>Additive Manufacturing using WAAM</h3>
        <p>Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) is a production process used to 3D print or repair metal parts. It belongs to the Direct Energy Deposition (DED) family of Additive Manufacturing processes. WAAM is executed by depositing layers of metal on top of each other until a desired 3D shape is created. It is a combination of two production processes: Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and additive manufacturing.</p>

    <h2>Fabrication of WAAM Walls</h2>
    <p>An experimental study was performed with an AWS ER 316L wire (1.2 mm in diameter), a 6-axis Kawasaki robot and a Fronius-320i CMT welding power source with CMT-Pulse method. The composition of the wire is presented in Table 1. Two walls comprising of 10 layers with two different deposition strategies were deposited based on the parameters provided in Table 3 and Table 4 below. The reason for depositing 10 layers was at this height, the process would have attained a uniform state, with a low heat sink as heat loss would mainly be by convection. The wall structures were deposited on an AISI 1080 substrate of dimension: 200 x 150 x 13 mm and 150 x 140 x 13 mm respectively.</p>

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
        <p>The visual inspection was carried out for both the fabricated walls. From the visual analysis, it is evident that the to-fro strategy is better than the linear left-right strategy. In the latter strategy, there was a dramatic deposition failure towards the end, where most of the metal was not deposited efficiently.</p>

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>The left-right and to-fro deposition strategies on 316 L wire-arc additive manufacture have been studied. The to-fro strategy is found to be better in terms of economic viability and utilization of material and energy. This strategy presents no loss of material and suggests flatness in the final bead aesthetics rather than convexity in the end as in the linear left-right strategy.</p>
