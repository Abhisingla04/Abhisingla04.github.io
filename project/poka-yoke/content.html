    <h1>Optimization of Tractor Production through Strategic Poka-Yoke Implementation</h1>
  
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Our production facility faced significant challenges due to the simultaneous manufacturing of over 100 variants of tractors, incorporating both new and old sheet metal components. This overlap often led to incorrect part fitment, particularly in critical components such as gearbox gears, sub-assemblies, shafts, bearings, tow hooks, angle brackets, and hoods. The issue was exacerbated by the impending obsolescence of old sheet metal parts, which further complicated the assembly process.</p>

    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Simultaneous Manufacturing</strong>: The production of over 100 variants of tractors at the same time.</li>
        <li><strong>Component Overlap</strong>: The use of both new and old sheet metal parts in the manufacturing process.</li>
        <li><strong>Critical Components Affected</strong>: Incorrect part fitment issues were particularly prevalent in gearbox gears, sub-assemblies, shafts, bearings, tow hooks, angle brackets, and hoods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>The overlap of new and old sheet metal components often led to incorrect part fitment. This was particularly problematic for critical components such as gearbox gears, sub-assemblies, shafts, bearings, tow hooks, angle brackets, and hoods. The issue was further complicated by the impending obsolescence of old sheet metal parts. One notable example was the differentiation between a constant mesh gear used in the gearbox and a bull gear in the differential. These gears, despite having physical design identifiers, were often confused due to their similar appearance and differing heat treatment processes.</p>

    <h3>Solution Implementation</h3>
    <p>To address these challenges, we designed and implemented poka-yokes to prevent errors and ensure the correct assembly of parts. One notable example was the differentiation between a constant mesh gear used in the gearbox and a bull gear in the differential. These gears, despite having physical design identifiers, were often confused due to their similar appearance and differing heat treatment processes.</p>
    <p>We developed a barcode scanning system to verify the correct parts at each assembly step. This system alerts the operator if an incorrect part is picked up, preventing errors before they occur. We collaborated with our programming team to map every tractor model and its variants into a comprehensive database. Additionally, we integrated the Bill of Materials (BOM) of each tractor from SAP with the physical gears’ part numbers.</p>

    <h3>System Development</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Mapping</strong>: We mapped every tractor model and its variants into a comprehensive database.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with SAP</strong>: We integrated the Bill of Materials (BOM) of each tractor from SAP with the physical gears’ part numbers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operator Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tablets with Software</strong>: Operators were provided with tablets equipped with software that allows them to scan the chassis number and retrieve the entire BOM from the SAP module, ensuring accurate part identification and usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Stacking and Tagging Parts</strong>: We worked closely with the stores team to devise a method of stacking and tagging parts using flags, further mitigating the risk of incorrect part feeding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Training and Implementation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Operator Training</strong>: The new system was implemented across the production line, and operators were trained to use the barcode scanners effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>System Implementation</strong>: The implementation of the new system significantly improved part fitment accuracy, enhanced production efficiency, thereby boosting product quality and customer satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results and Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Part Fitment Accuracy</strong>: The barcode scanning system ensured that the correct parts were used at each assembly step.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Production Efficiency</strong>: The new system streamlined the assembly process, reducing errors and increasing efficiency.</li>
        <li><strong>Boosted Product Quality</strong>: The accurate fitment of parts improved the overall quality of the tractors.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Customer Satisfaction</strong>: The improvements in product quality and production efficiency led to higher customer satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The successful implementation of poka-yoke and the barcode scanning system addressed the challenges faced by our production facility. The new system significantly improved part fitment accuracy, enhanced production efficiency, boosted product quality, and increased customer satisfaction. Moving forward, we will continue to monitor and improve the system to ensure ongoing success.</p>
