<h1>Optimization of Tractor Production through Strategic Poka-Yoke Implementation</h1>

<p><strong>Devised and implemented poka-yokes</strong> in a production facility handling over 100 tractor variants. Developed a <strong>barcode scanning system</strong> for part verification and integrated a comprehensive database with <strong>SAPâ€™s BOM</strong>. Collaborated with programming and stores teams to improve part identification, stacking, and tagging methods. This significantly mitigated the risk of incorrect part feeding.</p>

<p><strong>Training of operators</strong> on the new system led to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced production efficiency</li>
  <li>Reduced complaint reports</li>
  <li>Improved product quality</li>
  <li>Increased customer satisfaction</li>
</ul>
